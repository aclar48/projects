This assignment consists of the design and implementation of a program that produces a realistic
scene of your choice, using generic objects (sphere, cube, cylinder, tapered cylinder, cone, torus) for which
the parametric equations are known, and texture mapping techniques. You may shape the generic objects
using affine transformations (turning a sphere into an ellipsoid, for example). Your program must use various textures to render 
the scene, which can be animated or static, depending on your choices. 

Your program will perform the following:
<OL>
<LI>Use at least three different generic objects.
<p>
<LI>Use realistic textures.
<p>
<LI>Render the scene properly, using a perspective transformation matrix (or a synthetic camera, depending
    on the version of OpenGL you have chosen to use).
    <p>
<LI>The program will terminate when the user presses 'Q'.<p>
