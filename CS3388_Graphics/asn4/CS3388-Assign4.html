This assignment consists of the writing of a simple ray-tracing program that creates images of scenes
containing a number of simple generic objects. The ray tracing program must be able to:
<OL>
<LI> deal with spheres and planes of finite extent as generic objects
<p>
<LI> implement local shading 
<p>
<LI> implement shadowing through the use of feeler rays
<p>
<LI> capture user input to place and transform spheres and planes in the scene (in other words, the
     user must be able to specify the type of objects (spheres, planes) and enter a transformation matrix for
     each object, along with surface properties (color, specularity, etc)
<p>
<LI> capture user input to place the viewpoint within the scene and define a light source
<p>
<LI> Render the image on the screen 
</OL>
<p>
There is a 5 term-mark bonus for a correct recursive implementation of light refraction or reflection, or both.
