<p> The purpose of this first graphics assignment is to understand 
OpenGL 2D transformations (rotation, translation, and scaling)
    by programming an animation in which a number of rectangles of 
various initial color, sizes, positions, orientations, undergo
    2D transformations. The details of the assignment are given in point
 form below: 
</p><p>
</p><p>You may use any of the following platforms OpenGL ES 2.0, 
(android or iPhone), WebGL (any browser that supports HTML5) or, OpenGL 
in MC10 in the lab. OpenGl in MC10 is potentially very very very out of 
of date.  If you're having problems make sure you indicate which 
platform you're working on for help.   We will have an in class demo of 
assignments on October 8th (basically, show your assignment to the TA's 
in class, they'll write down that they saw it working and any problems 
they had).  You'll also do a short demo to your fellow students and talk
 quickly about what you did - ideally you'll talk to people who used 
other platforms and get some experience that way.  
</p><p>There is a small written portion to this assignment.  
When you are done the programming part, please include a brief (~1/2 page is fine) summary of:
</p><p>Any platform problems you had in getting setup, IDE, packages, 
development environments, device emulators etc. Any jargon you found in 
the documentation that you wasted a lot of time trying to figure out 
etc. 
</p><p>What, if any programming problems you had - you can be brief.
</p><p>And lastly:  How did you make any design choices that were 
needed? E.g. how did you decide if something was moving too fast or too 
slow, if there were too many or too few objects, how big the objects 
should be etc. 
</p><p>
</p><p>If the 'user input' stuff ends up being a disaster on mobile then we will adjust the grading accordingly. 
</p><ol>
  <p>
  </p><li>The window size for this animation is either your screen size 
or 640 by 640 pixels. The viewport area should be equal to the window. 
    <p></p></li><li>The background color of the window is black.
<p>
  </p></li><li>The number of rectangles in this animation is whatever you think looks best, and if you cannot decide, use 25.  
      <p>
</p></li><li>The color of each rectangle is determined randomly by generating three random numbers (comprised between 0 and 1) that
       are used as parameters to <tt>glColor3f()</tt> in fixed function or with a simple programmable shader in WebGL ES 2.0 etc.. Their color does not need to change over time.
       <p>
</p></li><li>The initial position of each rectangle is determined 
randomly. This random coordinate represents the initial translation
       for the rectangle. This initial translation is given by randomly 
generating to integer numbers between 0 and screen dimensions. 
  <p></p></li><li>The direction of the translation (or speed) is 
determined by a 2D vector. It is initialized with 2 random numbers 
between -1.0 and 1.0).
       During the animation, this vector is added to the initial 
translation of a rectangle in a cumulative manner in between each
       frame. 
<p>
</p></li><li>The initial size of the rectangle should be determined randomly, - within some reasonable range.  
  <p></p></li><li>The initial orientation of each rectangle is expressed
 as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees) and is initially randomly 
assigned.
       The direction of the rotation (clockwise or counter-clockwise) is
 determined randomly and should increase (or decrease) by a randomly
       generated angular increment, comprised between -0.5 and 0.5 
degree. The rotation must be about the center point of the rectangle.
<p>
</p></li><li>The rectangles will change shape slightly and rhythmically during the animation. You may use a scaling transformation 
       such as (fixed function) <tt>glScalef(1.0 + sin(angle/10.0)/5.0 ,1.0 + cos(angle/10.0)/5.0, 1.0)</tt>, where <tt>angle</tt> is the current
       rotation angle of the rectangle.
Or modelViewMatrix = objscale * </li></ol><p>
You must pay attention to various important details:
</p></font><ol><font face="Verdana">
<p>
</p><li>Double buffering must be used. Otherwise the animation will not work properly.  (Unless you use WebGl)
  <p>
</p></li><li>There is a defined order in which the transformations are applied, for them to work properly. You must also use (fixed function)
       <tt>glPushMatrix()</tt> before using <tt>glRotatef()</tt>, <tt>glTranslatef()</tt>, and <tt>glScalef()</tt>, followed
       by a <tt>glPopMatrix()</tt> instructions, or (programmable Pipeline) camRotate , camScale, camTranslate, objTranslate, objscale objRotate.  
       <p>
</p></li><li>When the program is invoked, the rectangles will appear but will remain motionless until the user presses the <tt>s</tt> key
       on the keyboard to start the animation. If you're on mobile... figure out some other input.  
  <p>
</p></li><li>The program will quit when the user presses the <tt>q</tt> key.  Your application should have a way to quit.  Have fun figuring out a way to do that on mobile.  
<p>      
</p></li><li>When a rectangle exits the window due to its translation, you must ensure that it will be wrapped around and reappear at its
       complementary position on the other side of the window.
